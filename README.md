 MSDA Program Portfolio
# This repository contains a few of the projects I completed in my graduate program at Western Governors Unitversity. 
# The data used was intentionally problematic so I had exposure to every day data science issues.
# The data was also intentionally incorrect with respect to real world stats so that I learned to allow the data to reveal information, not my preconceptions.
